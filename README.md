Hi, I’m cubee!

- I’m interested in game development, drawing, VR tech, and attempting to make stuff run on things they're not supposed to. (Beat Saber for PICO-8, anyone?)
- I've made quite a few small games. A few of my best projects include [Ninja Cat Remewstered](https://pixelshock.itch.io/ninja-cat-remewstered) for Windows/Linux/Android, and [Tomorrow's Vege-Mallet Therapy](https://pixelshock.itch.io/tomorrows-vege-mallet-therapy-in-20-seconds-or-less) and [BEATWISE TRIGGER](https://pixelshock.itch.io/a-rhythm-based-dungeon-crawler) for the PICO-8 fantasy console.
- Plotter of pixels and lines. (that means I do pixel and digital art) -> I drew my avatar :)
- I occasionally attempt to make some music, most of it isn't very good but occasionally I come up with something great. (that's how most things go, though)
- You can find a list of my profiles on my [website](https://cubee.games/?rel=links), or see the few that are linked on my profile here!
- Also, I made [Terra - A Terraria Demake](https://cubeegames.itch.io/terra-a-terraria-demake).

That's about it.
