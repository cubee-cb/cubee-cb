Hi, I’m cubee!

- I’m interested in game development, drawing, VR tech, and attempting to make stuff run on things they're not supposed to. (Beat Saber for PICO-8, anyone?)
- I've made quite a few small games. My current projects include a remaster of Ninja Cat, and Everlost Isle, which might be a survival-bullet-hell game.
- You can find a list of my profiles on my [website](https://cubee.games/?rel=links), or see the few that are linked on my profile here!
- Fun fact: I made Terra - A Terraria Demake.

Yes, this is pretty much the default Github profile readme template. What more do I want to say though?
